# Analysis of Weekly Influenza (Type A and B) Cases in the US (2023-24)

## Overview
This project analyzes the weekly data on Influenza Type A and Type B cases in the US for the period 2023-24. Using rolling mean and standard deviation, it aims to reveal trends, patterns, and variability to understand the seasonal behavior and potential outbreaks of influenza.

## Introduction
Influenza, commonly known as the flu, is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. There are four types of the influenza virus:
- **Influenza A** viruses cause seasonal flu epidemics nearly every year in the United States and can infect both humans and animals. It is the only type that can cause a pandemic, as seen in bird flu and swine flu pandemics.
- **Influenza B** viruses also lead to seasonal epidemics, typically affecting only humans. Compared to Influenza A, Influenza B viruses mutate more slowly.
- **Influenza C** viruses cause mild illnesses and do not seem to cause epidemics.
- **Influenza D** viruses mainly affect cattle and do not infect humans.
  
Monitoring and analyzing influenza case data is essential for public health as it helps identify seasonal trends, monitor outbreaks, and guide effective intervention strategies.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is titled “Influenza Positive Tests Reported to CDC by Clinical Laboratories, National Summary, 2023-24 Season”, covering the period up to the week ending June 29, 2024. The data is sourced from the [CDC Flu Weekly Reports](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm).

For this project, the dataset was processed to focus on the number of positive cases for Influenza Type A and Type B each week.

## Tools and Libraries
**Programming Language:** Python
- Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and preparation.
- Matplotlib: Employed for creating visualizations - line plots and rolling mean/standard deviation plots.

## Program Code
The program was written in PyCharm. You may run the program on Google Colab by clicking on the colab badge below.
